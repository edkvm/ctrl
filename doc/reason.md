#### The Problem
Developers spend a lot of their time on routine and mundane tasks  
like migration, data entry, data enrichment, non critical business related  
task.
Developing these tasks is annoying but running or repeating them in a later  
stage is a major hassle. 


#### Proposed solution
Personal CI?



#### Ideas in the same vicinity
- Zapier
- IFFFT
- TriggerHappy(OSS)
- Huginn(OSS)
- Serverless
- Apex/Up


#### Assumptions
Developers like to write code.

Learning how to integrate or interact with closed platforms like zapier  
is considered a waste of time(Solution: open platform, simple interface).

Developers write a lot of open source code which is mostly usless  
only big and prominent projects get picked up.

Allowing developers to write small, less than 100 loc, programs that can  
be used right away by third party collaborators is a big value proposition  
for developers.

Developing the correct interface is crucial, multiple interface should be studied
